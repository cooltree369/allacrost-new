*** \brief Abstract class that represents objects on a map
***
*** A map object can be anything from a sprite to a tree to a house. To state
*** it simply, a map object is a map image that is not tiled and need not be fixed
*** in place. Map objects are drawn in one of three layers: ground, pass, and sky
*** object layers.

*** All map objects have both a collision rectangle and an image rectangle.
*** The collision rectangle indicates what parts of the object may not overlap
*** with other collision rectangles and unwalkable sections of the map. The image
*** rectangle determines the size of the object as it is visible on the screen.
*** The collision rectangle and image rectangles do not need to be the same size.
*** Typically the collision rectangle is smaller than the image rectangle. It is
*** also possible to disable both rectangles via special properties that can be
*** enabled in this class. This would prevent the object from being a factor in
*** collision detection and/or it would never be drawn to the screen.
***
*** State information about map objects may need to be retained upon leaving a
*** map. For example, a treasure (which is a type of map object) needs to know
*** whether or not the player has retrieved its contents already so that they
*** can not be gained a second time. This data is stored in the saved game file
*** so that even when the player exits the game, the state information can be
*** retrieved when the application starts again later.
***
*** \note It is advised not to attempt to make map objects with dynamic sizes (i.e.
*** the various image frames that compose the object should all be the same size).
*** In theory, dynamically sized objects are feasible to implement in maps, but
*** they are much easier to be subject to bugs and other issues.

	*** \todo One possible downside to this algorithm is that it doesn't take into account other nearby objects that could be
	*** in the way. Theoretically if we had a line of sprites standing in an open plane and we tried to move one sprite through the middle
	*** of them, the sprite would continue to oscillate around this living wall thinking it has found a gap to get through when
	*** there is none. This is something to consider addressing in the future.
