*** \brief Abstract class that represents objects on a map
***
*** A map object can be anything from a sprite to a tree to a house. To state
*** it simply, a map object is a map image that is not tiled and may not be fixed
*** in place. Map objects are drawn in one of three layers: ground, pass, and sky
*** object layers. Every map object has a collision rectangle associated with it.
*** The collision rectangle indicates what parts of the object may not overlap with
*** other collision rectangles.
***
*** \note It is advised not to attempt to make map objects with dynamic sizes (i.e.
*** the various image frames that compose the object are all the same size). In
*** theory, dynamically sized objects are feasible to implement in maps, but they
*** are much more vulnerable to bugs
*** ***************************************************************************/

	*** Player sprites are assigned object ids from 5000 and above. Technically this means that

	*** need to contain that many objects in the first place. Objects with an ID less than zero

	*** Context helps to determine where an object "resides". For example, inside of a house or
	*** outside of a house. The context member determines if the object should be drawn or not,
	*** since objects are only drawn if they are in the same context as the map's camera.
	*** Objects can only interact with one another if they both reside in the same context.
	*** 
	*** \note The default value for this member is -1. A negative context indicates that the
	*** object is invalid and it does not exist anywhere. Objects with a negative context are never
	*** drawn to the screen. A value equal to zero indicates that the object is "always in
	*** context", meaning that the object will be drawn regardless of the current context. An

	*** as where the objects collision rectangle lies.
	*** 
	*** The position coordinates are described by an integer (position) and a float (offset).
	*** The position coordinates point to the map grid tile that the object currently occupies
	*** and may range from 0 to the number of columns or rows of grid tiles on the map. The

	*** center, and it is more convenient to store only half the sprite's width as a result.

	*** extends the length of 1/2 of a tile from the origin on both sides, and a y value
	*** of 1.0f means that the collision area exists from the origin to 1 tile's length
