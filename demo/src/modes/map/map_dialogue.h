*** \brief   Header file for map mode dialogue
***
*** \todo There is A LOT of indexing and id referencing in this code and in the
*** MapSprite's dialogue-related code. Currently very little is done to warn of
*** bad references (a sprite referencing a dialogue via an invalid ID) or bad
*** indexing (indexing a line of dialogue that does not exist/out of bounds errors).
*** The reason why things are this way right now is because sprites and dialogues
*** can be created in any order (and can even be created after the map has been loaded
*** and is in play). Because of this, the code may be referencing things that are
*** not yet created but will be shortly, so we don't want to print warnings about
*** those types of circumstances. What I think we should do is write a "CheckWarnings"
*** function or something similar that can be called after it is determined that
*** everything *should* be created and referenced properly.

*** \brief Represents dialogues between characters on a map
***
*** Dialogues consist of multiple lines. Each line of a dialogue contains the
*** following information:
***
*** -# The text of the line
*** -# An object ID that indicates who is currently speaking the line
*** -# A value that indicates the maximum time that the line should be displayed
*** -# A pointer to a script function to execute after the line is finished
***
*** Dialogues may also have a set of options attached to it. Each set of options
*** in a dialogue are represented by an instance of the MapDialogueOptions class.
*** The options are stored in a vector of MapDialogueOptions object pointers. This
*** vector is indexed by the lines of dialogue, so options for line 3 would be stored
*** in _options[3]. A null value would mean there are no options for that line of
*** dialogue.
***
*** Both the display time value and the script function pointer are optional and
*** do not need to be set for every line of dialogue. Dialogues may also be "blocked",
*** which means that they ignore the user's input while the dialogue is executing.
*** The map file retains the number of times each dialogue in the map has been
*** seen by the player so that subsequent visits to the map do not falsely display
*** sprites as having new dialogue.
***
*** The standard order of lines in a dialogue begin with the first line and end
*** with the last (as stored in the lines container). However this need not be
*** the case and quite often is not. After reading a line, you may proceed to any
*** other line in a dialogue. The next line can be chosen either by selecting a
*** particular option presented on a line, or looking up the next line value in a
*** class container. It can also be explicity set when calling the ReadNextLine
*** method to finish reading the current line, although this is usually only done
*** by the dialogue manager when processing a selected dialogue option.
***
*** When a dialogue is finished, usually the state of all speaker sprites is
*** restored (uch as the direction they were facing prior to the dialogue) so that
*** they can resume their prior activity. Also for dialogues which are "owned" by
*** a sprite (where owned simply means that the dialogue instance is retained in
*** the MapSprite#_dialogues container), the sprite is informed that the
*** dialogue has finished so that the sprite may re-check whether or not all
*** dialogues that it contains have been seen by the player.
***
*** \todo MapDialogues need to be made more generic. They should not require a
*** speaker ID (ie we can have a "narrator" of sorts), they should not require
*** a portrait, and they should not be contained within the MapSprite class.
*** Dialogues should be retained by the DialogueWindow class and sprites should
*** reference these dialogues via a dialogue ID as appropriate.
