*** \brief Represents an area where the active map context may switch
***
*** This type of zone enables map sprites to transfer betweeen two map contexts.
*** Each zone section added is labeled as corresponding to one context or the
*** other. When a sprite stands upon a particular section, their context will
*** be set to the context of that section.
***
*** \todo In the future collision detection needs to be accounted for when two
*** objects are in the context zone but have different active map contexts.
*** Normally no collision detection is done between objects in different contexts,
*** but context zones need to be an exception to this rule.
***
*** \todo Currently the Update() function checks all ground objects to determine
*** if any context changes need to occur. This is a temporarily solution that needs
*** to be improved by the following:
***  - The class should have a container of objects currently located within the zone,
***    and check only those objects (when sprites are in motion, they can check if they
***    have stepped into a context zone there)
***  - Sky objects should also be able to change their context via context zones
***  - There should be an option for having the context zone not to apply to either the
***    ground or sky object layers
***
*** \bug MapZone::AddSection() is invalid for this function
*** If the MapZone::AddSection() function is called instead of the ContextZone
*** one (which has a different signature), then the _section_contexts vector will
*** be unequal in size to the _sections vector, and this could result in an out
*** of bounds access error later during the game's execution.
