*** \brief Handles the game operation during a pause or quit user request
***
*** This mode is normally entered when the player inputs a pause or quit command.
*** This class uses a captured screen image as its background and displays either
*** the text "PAUSED" or a quit options menu depending on the state that the mode
*** is set in. The constructor also allows you the option to automatically pause
*** the audio while the game is in this mode of operation.
***
*** When the quit state is active, the player can choose between three options:
*** - Quit Game         :: Exits the application entirely
*** - Quit to Main Menu :: Returns to boot mode, emptying the game stack in the process
*** - Cancel            :: Unpauses the game
***
*** \note When the user enters this mode, the game will sleep for small periods
*** of time so that the application isn't using up 100% of the CPU.
***
*** \note If the user inputs a quit event when this mode is active and in the
*** quit state, the game will exit immediately. If the user inputs a quit event
*** when the quit state is not active, then the quit state is activated.
