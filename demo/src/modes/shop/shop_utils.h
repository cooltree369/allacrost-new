*** \brief An abstract class for displaying a list of shop objects
***
*** This class is used to display a list of shop objects to the user along with
*** certain properties. It uses two OptionBox objects to achieve this, which are
*** placed side by side. The left list, "identify", contains indentifying information
*** of the shop object, usually its name and image icon. The right list, "properties",
*** contains several properties of the object. Both lists have the same number of rows,
*** where a row represents a single object, the identify list has only a single column
*** while the property list has four columns.
***
*** The deriving class determines what data is placed in both the identify and property
*** lists. It will define the ReconstructList() and RefreshEntry() methods to achieve
*** this. The lists are always drawn on the right side of the middle shop window and
*** display no more than eight entries at a time. If desired, a deriving class can
*** retrieve references to the OptionBox objects representing both lists in this class
*** and change their default properties to fit one's needs.
***
*** \note Because the data used to construct this list are a series of ShopObject pointers,
*** this means that the object data can and often is modified outside of this class. It is
*** up to the user of this class to determine when the object data has been modified and
*** to refresh the list data as appropriate.
