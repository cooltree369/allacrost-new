*** \brief An interface to prevent the player from leaving the shop with marked transactions
***
*** This interface is only entered if the player tries to leave the shop and they still
*** have marked purchases, sales, or trades. Its primary purpose is to serve as a fail-safe
*** so that the player doesn't accidentally leave the shop before they complete their transaction.
*** The class itself is similar in display and function to the ConfirmInterface, but it uses a
*** reduced subset of the abilities found in that interface. Specifically the player may not modify
*** their order in any way from this interface, although they can view their order and selected
*** objects in that order.
***
***
*** After the player has selected their purchases, sales, and trades, they typically
*** enter this interface to finalize their choices and complete the transaction. There
*** are four primary actions that a player may chose from while in this interface.
***
*** -# "View Order": allows the player to view the buy/sell/trade lists and selected entries
*** -# "Confirm Order": sends the player to the confirm interface so that the order can be completed
*** -# "Leave Shop": leaves shop mode entirely without further interruption
