*** \brief Assists the RootInterface in proper draw orientation of object category icons and text
***
*** Shops have anywhere between one and eight different categories of objects that they may deal in.
*** One job of the root interface is to display the icon and name of all categories which the shop
*** deals in. This information is displayed in rows of four. To keep the interface looking nice and consistent
*** with all the different possible combinations of category numbers, the y draw position for the rows is altered
*** depending on whether one or two rows are to be drawn. The x draw position of the category icons and text is
*** also variable depending on the number of categories to be drawn in that row.

*** \brief The highest level shopping interface which displays information about the shop
***
*** This interface is the first information that the player sees when entering the shop.
*** Its function serves two purposes. The first is to allow the user to select between the
*** primary shop actions which are: buy, sell, trade, confirm, and leave. Its second purpose
*** is to display statistical information about the shop, including its name, price levels,
*** the type of wares it deals in, and a short greeting message from the shop keeper.
***
*** The top window contains the shop actions which the user may select from. Take note that
*** the processing and display code for this segment is managed by the ShopMode class and not
*** here. This is so because the top window is mostly static throughout the different interface
*** classes, so having ShopMode manage it eliminates redundant code.
***
*** The middle window contains the name of the shop at the top. Below that are star indicators
*** that inform the user how good the buy and sell prices for the shop are. The more stars, the
*** better it is to buy or sell equipment at the shop. Below the price information are a series
*** of icon images and labels that represent each type of object which may be bought or sold.
*** Not all stores deal in all types of objects, so those object types which the store does not
*** deal in are displayed in grayscale text.
***
*** Finally, the bottom window contains nothing more than a short message or greeting from the
*** shop keeper.
