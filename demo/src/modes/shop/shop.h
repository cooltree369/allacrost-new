*** \brief A companion class to ShopMode that holds various multimedia data
***
*** All of the shop mode interfaces share media data in forming their presentations.
*** This class retains all of this common media data and makes it available for
*** the shop interfaces to utilize. Like ShopMode, this class contains a static
*** pointer to an object of the class type that represents the current instance
*** of the class. This makes it easier for the code to get access to the data.
*** Below is a typical use case for this class:
***
*** ShopMedia::CurrentInstance()->GetObjectCategoryImages();
***
*** \note The accessor methods return non-const pointers to the relevant data
*** structures and objects. This is done for reasons of convenience as many places
*** in the shop code wish to make non-const copies of data stored in this class.
*** Take care not to abuse these pointers and modify the state of any of the data
*** members in this class as it would have negative repercussions.
