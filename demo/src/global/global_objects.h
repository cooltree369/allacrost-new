*** \brief An abstract base class for representing a game object

*** All game objects inherit from this class. This allows objects of all types to
*** be stored in the same container (an inventory list for instance) and promotes
*** efficient code reuse for all game objects. The class is designed so that a
*** single class object can represent multiple instances of the same game object.
*** In other words, you can represent 50 healing potions with a single GlobalObject
*** class object rather than having to create and managed 50 class objects, one for
*** each potion. The _count member achieves this convenient function.
***
*** A GlobalObject with an ID value of zero is considered invalid. Most of the
*** protected members of this class can only be set by the constructors or methods
*** of deriving classes.
***
*** \note The price of an object is not actually the price it is bought or sold
*** at in the game. It is a "base price" from which all levels of buy and sell
*** prices are derived from.
***
*** \todo The "lore" for an object is a feature that we have discussed but not
*** yet decided if we wish to implement. Placeholders exist in this class for now,
*** but if lore is not to be implemented as a game feature they should be removed.
