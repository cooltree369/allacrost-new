*** \brief A timer assistant useful for monitoring progress and processing event sequences
***
*** This is a light-weight class for a simple timer. This class is designed specifically for
*** use by the various game mode classes, but it is certainly capable of being utilized just
*** as effectively by the engine or or other parts of the code. The operation of this class
*** is also integrated with the SystemEngine class, which routinely updates and manages timers.
*** The features of this timing mechanism include:
***
*** - manual update of timer by a specified amount of time
*** - the ability to enable timers to be updated automatically
*** - allowance to loop for an arbitrary number of times, including an infinte number of loops
*** - declaring a timer to be owned by a game mode and enable the timer to be automatically paused/resumed
***
*** When the timer is in the manual update mode, the timer must have its Update() function invoked manually
*** from whatever code is storing/managing the timer. In auto update mode, the timer will update automatically
*** whenever the SystemEngine updates itself in the main game loop. The default mode for timers is manual update.
***
*** \note The auto pausing mechanism can only be utilized by timers that have auto update enabled and are owned
*** by a valid game mode. The way it works is by detecting when the active game mode (AGM) has changed and pausing
*** all timers which are not owned by the AGM and un-pausing all timers which are owned to the AGM.
