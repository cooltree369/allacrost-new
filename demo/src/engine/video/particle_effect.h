 * \brief   Header file for particle effects
 *
 * Particle effects are basically nothing more than a collection of particle
 * systems. Many effects are just one system. However, for example, if you think
 * about a campfire effect, that might actually consist of fire + smoke + embers.
 * So, that's an example of an effect that consists of 3 systems.
 *
 * This file contains two classes: ParticleEffectDef, and ParticleEffect.
 *
 * ParticleEffectDef is a "definition" class, which holds a list of
 *    ParticleSystemDefs.
 *
 * ParticleEffect is an "instance" class, which holds a list of
 *    ParticleSystems.
 *
 *
 * This way, if you have 100 explosions, the properties of the
 * effect are stored only once in a ParticleEffectDef, and the only thing that 
 * gets repeated 100 times is the ParticleEffect, which holds instance-specific stuff.
