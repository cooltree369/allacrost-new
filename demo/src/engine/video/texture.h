*** \file    tex_mgmt.h
*** \author  Raj Sharma, roos@allacrost.org
*** \brief   Header file for texture management code
***
*** We use texture management so that at runtime, we can load many small images
*** (e.g. tiles) and stick them together into larger textures called "texture
*** sheets". This improves performance, because then we don't have to constantly
*** switch textures while rendering.
***
*** This file contains several classes:
***
*** - <b>TexSheet</b>: represents a large OpenGL texture which is shared among
*** multiple texture objects (images). Abstract to allow for derivative classes
*** to define how they manage their texture objects.
***
*** - <b>FixedTexSheet</b>: a texture sheet for fixed-size textures, i.e. 32x32
*** This class can do all of its operations in O(1) time because it knows in
*** advance that all textures are the same size.
***
*** - <b>FixedTexNode</b>: represents a texture node entry for the
*** FixedTexSheet class.
***
*** - <b>VariableTexSheet</b>: a texture sheet for variable-size textures.
*** This sheet allows textures of any size to be inserted, but has slower
*** performance than the FixedTexSheet.
***
*** - <b>VariableTexNode</b>: represents a texture node entry for the
*** VariableTexSheet class.
