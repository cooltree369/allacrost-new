 * \brief   Header file for particle system
 *
 * This file contains two classes: ParticleSystemDef, and ParticleSystem.
 *
 * ParticleSystemDef is a "definition" class, meaning that it holds information 
 * about a particle system, like its lifetime, the emitter, and other properties.
 *
 * ParticleSystem is an "instance" class, meaning that it holds information about
 * a particle system which is currently being drawn on screen.
 *
 * This way, if you have 100 explosions for example, the properties of the
 * effect are stored only once, and the only thing that gets repeated 100 times
 * is instance-specific stuff like positions of vertices, etc.

	//! Each system contains 1 emitter, which mainly determines where to shoot particles out from
	//! and how fast to shoot them out
	ParticleEmitter emitter;
	
	//! Array of keyframes, which specify how particle properties vary over time. This array must
	//! contain at least 1 keyframe (in that case, the properties are all held constant)
	std::vector <ParticleKeyframe *> keyframes;

	//! How to blend the particles: VIDEO_NO_BLEND, VIDEO_BLEND, or VIDEO_BLEND_ADD
	//! For most effects, we want VIDEO_BLEND_ADD
	int32 blend_mode;
	
	//! How many seconds the system should live for before it dies out. This is only
	//! meaningful if our emitter mode is EMITTER_MODE_ONE_SHOT. The other modes
	//! will simply keep playing until the effect is destroyed or stopped, except for
	//! EMITTER_MODE_BURST, which spits out a bunch of particles at the beginning and
	//! then dies as soon as all of those particles die
	float system_lifetime;
	
	//! How long each particle should live for before it dies	
	float particle_lifetime;
	
	//! Random variation added to particle lifetime
	float particle_lifetime_variation;
	
	//! Maximum number of particles this system can have at one time
	int32 max_particles;
	
	//! A number below 1.0 (but generally pretty close to 1.0). A damp of .99 means that
	//! each second, particle velocity drops by 1%
	float damping;	
	
	//! Random variation added to damping
	float damping_variation;
	
	//! constant acceleration, good example is gravity. Note that down is in the positive y
	//! direction since we are using screen coordinates
	float acceleration_x;
	float acceleration_y;
	
	float acceleration_variation_x;

	//! wind velocity, more generally any velocity which is added to each particle's velocity

	float wind_velocity_variation_y;
		
	//! true if we should use wave motion for this system
	bool  wave_motion_used;
	
	//! wavelength. For example a wavelength of 5 means that it takes 5 seconds to go from
	//! one point on the sinusoidal curve to the next

	//! wave amplitude- the distance from the peak to the bottom of the sinusoidal curve
	float wave_amplitude;
	
	//! Random variation added to wave amplitude

	//! tangential acceleration, how particle accelerates tangential to vector from particle
	//! to center of emitter region. Positive is clockwise.
	float tangential_acceleration;
	
	//! tangential acceleration variation

	//! acceleration. The user defined attractor is set using ParticleEffect::SetAttractorPoint()
	bool user_defined_attractor;
	
	//! how quickly the "pull" of an attractor falls off as a particle gets further away from it.
	//! For example if falloff is 10^-3, and a particle is 500 pixels away from the attractor, 
	//! then the radial acceleration is lessened by (500 * 10^-3) = .5, or 50%
	float attractor_falloff;	
			
	//! True if ANY of the keyframes for the particles contain non-zero rotations
	//! This is used by the Draw() function so it knows whether it needs to factor in
	//! rotations when determining the particle vertices (since this adds a lot of extra
	//! computation)
	bool rotation_used;	
	
	//! True if you want particles to rotate to face the same direction they are going.
	//! So for example a particle going straight up will not be rotated, but a particle
	//! that is going 45 degrees northeast will be rotated 45 degrees clockwise

	//! rotate to velocity is also used.

	//! this number is multiplied by a particle's speed to come up with a scale of how much
	//! to stretch a particle in its direction of motion
	float speed_scale;
	

	//! if you use speed_scale, this can cause particles to become extremely tiny at low speeds
	//! this variable allows you to set a minimum bound on the scaling due to speed
	float min_speed_scale;


	//! if you use speed_scale, this can cause particles to become extremely large at high speeds
	//! this variable allows you to set a maximum bound on the scaling due to speed

	//! True if alpha blending should be used to create smooth transitions between animation
	//! frames

	//! True if this system should not actually write to the screen, but instead modify the
	//! stencil buffer. Every time a pixel passes the alpha test, the stencil buffer will be
	//! modified, according to _stencil_op
	bool modify_stencil;
	
	//! if modify stencil is true, then the operation to use when the alpha test passes
	//! can either be VIDEO_STENCIL_OP_INCREASE, VIDEO_STENCIL_OP_ONE, VIDEO_STENCIL_OP_ZERO, or
	//! VIDEO_STENCIL_OP_DECREASE. The stencil test we use is "equal to 1"
	
	VIDEO_STENCIL_OP stencil_op;
	
	
	//! if this is true, then we only draw in areas where the stencil buffer contains a 1.
	//! Note that _use_stencil and _modify_stencil cannot both be 1 at the same time	
	bool use_stencil;


	//! Value from 0 to 1.0f, tells how strongly to modulate the particle colors by the scene
	//! lighting. If 0, then it's not weighted at all. If 1, then we multiply the particle color
	//! by the scene lighting. If it's somewhere between 0 and 1, then we calculate a color which
	//! is somewhere between white and the scene lighting color, and modulate with that.
