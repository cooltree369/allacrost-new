	*** \param bottom_left Sets the background color for the bottom left portion of the skin
	*** \param bottom_right Sets the background color for the bottom right portion of the skin
	*** \param make_default If this skin should be the default menu skin to be used, set this argument to true
	*** \return True if the skin was loaded successfully, or false in case of an error
	***
	*** A few notes about this function:
	*** - If you set a background image, any background colors will not be visible unless the background image has some transparency
	*** - If no other menu skins are loaded when this function is called, the default skin will automatically be set to this skin,
