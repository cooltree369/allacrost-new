 * \brief   Header file for particle emitter
 *
 * This file contains the ParticleEmitter class, and some enumerations for
 * emitter properties.
 *
 * ParticleEmitter stores info about how a system emits particles. This is made
 * up of two things:
 *
 *  1) Where are particles emitted?
 *      -For example, you could create a circle-shaped emitter, and then every
 *         time a particle is emitted, a random spot in that circle is chosen.
 *
 *  2) When are particles emitted?
 *      -For example, you could emit them all at once, or slowly through the
 *         life of the system.

 *         of the screen, and particles will be generated anywhere along that line.
