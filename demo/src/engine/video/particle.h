 * \brief   Header file for particle data
 *
 * This file contains structure(s) for representing a single particle. In theory,
 * we should be able to just have one structure which holds all properties for
 * a particle, but in fact we have two: one for the position, and one for everything
 * else. The reason is that having the positions separated is more efficient
 * for rendering.

 *  \brief this is used in the vertex array for DrawArrays(). Every time
 *         the particle system is rendered, we need to iterate through all the
 *         particles in the system, and use the position, size, and rotation
 *         to generate 4 ParticleVertex's. This is pretty expensive, but
 *         unfortunately it's necessary since the positions change every frame.
