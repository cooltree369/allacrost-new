-- Filename: head_armor.lua
--
-- Description: This file contains the definitions of all head armors that exist
-- in Hero of Allacrost. Each armor has a unique integer identifier that is used
-- as its key in the armor table below.
--
-- Note (1): Armors ids do *not* need to be sequential. When you make a new 
-- armor, keep it grouped with similar head armor types (helmets, caps, etc.)
-- and keep some space between groups. This way, we won't get a garbled mess of
-- head armor definitions.
--
-- Note (2): Valid ids for head armors are 20001-30000. Do not go out of bounds
-- with this limit, as other value ranges correspond to other types of objects
-- (items, weapons, etc.)
