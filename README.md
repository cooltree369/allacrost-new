This is the main project page and mercurial code repository for the Hero of Allacrost project. Hero of Allacrost is a 2D single-player role-playing game that is open source and free to play. Allacrost is designed in the image of classic console RPGs where our focus is on a compelling story and engaging gameplay. The game and editor is available for Linux, OS X, and Windows systems, and has been ported to others as well.
