This is the main project page and mercurial code repository for the Hero of Allacrost project. Hero of Allacrost is a 2D single-player role-playing game that is open source and free to play. Allacrost is designed in the image of classic console RPGs where our focus is on a compelling story and engaging gameplay. The game and editor is available for Linux, OS X, and Windows systems, and has been ported to others as well.

# **Players** #
See the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/allacrost/allacrost/downloads) section and select the release files corresponding to your operating system. 

We publish two types of releases.
* **Development releases** are a snapshot of the current state of development and often include missing content and are more unstable and buggy.  
* **Official releases** are a stable, mature, and final product.

We provide support for the latest official releases and a limited amount of support for other releases. OS X and Windows releases are packaged with an installer, while the Linux release is a tarball that must be built from scratch. You can also build the game yourself if you are inclined to do so. Refer to the following pages on our wiki for further information on building or installing Allacrost on your system.
