 * \brief An internal class used for retaining audio state information.

 * When a game mode is made to be the new active game mode of the stack, sometimes
 * we will wish to retain information about the audio state. This is so that when
 * we restore the previously active state again, the audio can resume as if no interruption
 * had occured.
 *
 * This class takes a snapshot of the audio state and saves the following information:
 *  - The listener properties
 *  - The attenutation distance model
 *  - Which sources are assigned to which buffers
 *  - The source properties
 *  - The position of each audio source that was playing when the call was made.

 * \brief A singleton class for managing and interfacing with audio data.
 *
 * This class manages all audio data allocation and manipulation. The OpenAL sources
 * are wrapped inside this class and OpenAL buffers (which are represented by the
 * SoundDescriptor and MusicObject classes) grab these sources as they need them. The
 * buffers are stored in map structures so that audio data is not loaded when it already
 * exists.
 *
 * \note 1) Operations that load audio data should be done during parts of the game
 * when game modes are being created and destroyed. In other words, ideally you should
 * load data into SoundSource and MusicSource objects when a new game mode class object is created,
 * instead of creating them only immediately before they are needed.
 *
 * \note 2) This audio engine uses smart memory management so that loaded audio
 * data is not re-loaded if the user requests a load operation on the same
 * data. Audio data is only freed once there are no more references to the
 * data.
