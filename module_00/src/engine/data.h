	 *  \brief This function allows you to call arbitrary Lua functions from C++
	 *  \param *func a string containing the name of the Lua function to be called
	 *  \param *sig a string describing arguments and results. See below for explanation.
	  
	    This function is an almost identical copy of the call_va() function from the book
	    "Programming In Lua", chapter 25.3. It lets you call an arbitrary Lua function with
	    a desired number of arguments and results.
	    
	    Here's how the *sig string is used: for example, if you want to call a function that
	    receives two integeres, and returns a double and a string, then *sig would equal "ii>ds".
	    The ">" is used to delimit results from arguments. Here is a list of descriptors you can use:
	    "i" - an integer value
	    "d" - double precision floating point value
	    "s" - a string. When supplying CallGlobalFunction with a variable to hold the return value of
	          string type, you should supply the address of a char* . Example: 
	            char *retval = 0;
	            CallGlobalFunction("function_returning_a_string", ">s", &retval);
	    The function allocates the space for the string.

	/*! \name Lua<->C++ binding functions
	 *  \brief Functions used to bind C++ class member functions and objects to be used directly from Lua.
	 *  \param *obj the object to be registered (see notes below)
	 *  \param *objname the name by which the object will be referred from Lua
	 *  \param func a pointer to the function to be registered
	 *  \param *funcname the name by which the function will be referred to from Lua
	  
	    Calling protocol:
	    1. RegisterClassStart()
	    2. RegisterMemberFunction(...), and/or RegisterObject(...), in any order.
	    3. RegisterClassEnd()
	    
	    The RegisterFunction() function can be called at any time, independently of the other functions
	    from this group.
	    
	    Notes on usage:
	    
	    - When calling RegisterMemberFunction, the second parameter (Class *obj) should be specified like this:
	        (MyClass*)0
	      For example:
	      	RegisterMemberFunction("GetSomething", (MyClass*)0, &MyClass::GetSomething);
	      Why add that argument when it's not used, you ask? Well, LuaPlus needs that cast because of it's
	      template magic, and that's the easy way to let it know what class it's working with.
	      But, when calling RegisterObject(), you specify a valid object pointer (don't forget the cast).
	    
	    - One RegisterClassStart/RegisterClassEnd block creates one Lua metatable and uses it to assign C++ stuff.
	      What this means is that if you register all the members of a class and, say, one object of that class
	      inside one RCS/RCE block, and then make a new block which just registers another object of the
	      same class, that won't work, because that object will be assigned a NEW (and empty) metatable.
	      The solution: either register all the objects you need inside one RCS/RCE block, or re-register all the
	      class methods the object needs inside the second block too. This can be useful, actually.
	      See the HTML documentation for a more detailed explanation.
