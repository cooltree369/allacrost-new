 * \brief A mobile map object with which the player can interact with.
 *
 * Map sprites are basically animate, "living" map objects. Although there is
 * but a single class to represent all the map sprites in the game, they can
 * actually be divided into the following categories:
 *
 * - Virtual sprites (a controllable, invisible map camera of sorts)
 * - Playable character sprites (those that are in the player's party)
 * - NPC (non-playable character) sprites.
 * - Enemy sprites
 * - Other sprites (like animals, etc.)
 *
 * It is easier to manage a single sprite class rather than several classes for
 * each sprite type. The fact that there is only one class for representing
 * several sprite types is the reason why many of these class members are pointers.
 * For example, we don't need dialogue for a dog sprite, so we don't want to waste
 * unnecessary space.
 *
 * \note 1) The vertical or "Z" position of the object is contained in the lower
 * 8 bits of the status member. I may change this so z position is self-contained
 * in another member of this class later.
