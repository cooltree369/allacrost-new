/** \brief Returns the tablespace name of a given Lua file
*** \param filename The fully qualified name of the Lua file
***
*** Many of our Lua files need to have their contents encapsulated in a table that we call the file's tablespace
*** (because the table serves the same function as a namespace in C++). The tablespace's purpose is to prevent
*** any name collision of variables, functions, and so on between multiple Lua files. The tablespace is near the top
*** of the Lua file and looks like this:
***
*** local ns = {}
*** setmetatable(ns, {__index = _G})
*** my_tablespace_name = ns;
*** setfenv(1, ns);
***
*** Our convention is to name the tablespace after the name of the file it is contained in, so "lua/data/my_file.lua"
*** would have a tablespace name of "my_file". This function takes the filename and returns the expected name of its
*** tablespace.
***
*** \note Not all Lua files have a tablespace. This function does not tell you whether or not a file has a tablespace.
***
*** \note Lua identifiers must start with a character, so in the case of files that start with a non-alphabetic character such
*** as a number, the tablespace name is prepended with an 'a'

/** ****************************************************************************
*** \brief A container that manages the occurences of several related game records
***
*** Records in Allacrost are nothing more than a string-integer pair. The string
*** represents the name of the record while the integer takes on various meanings
*** about the record. Here are a few examples of how records are used:
***
*** - Record if the player has already seen a certain event sequence on a map.
*** - Whether the player chose option A, B, C, or D in a particular dialogue
*** - Record the number of hidden treasures a player has found on a map
***
*** Keeping so many records across the entire course of the game can result in a very
*** large data structure, and likewise a slower than desirable lookup time. To mitigate
*** this and also avoid record name collision between two distant areas of gameplay,
*** all records are stored within a record group, represented by this class. All record
*** groups are named, which is used to retrieve the appropriate group in the GlobalManager.
*** As an example, every map script file has their own record group name.
***
*** \note The GameGlobal class maintains a container of CommonRecordGroup objects and
*** provides methods to allow the creation, modification, and retrieval of these objects.
