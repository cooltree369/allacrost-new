*** \brief A bare-bones mode that is almost completely implemented in a Lua script file
***
*** Custom modes are usually built for simple, short scenes such as displaying a background
*** graphic or text on a black screen. But as their name implies, custom modes are flexible
*** and can be designed to implement any sort of functionality desired. The scripts for custom
*** game mode implementations are usually found in lua/scripts/custom/.
***
*** \note There are several important things to keep in mind when implementing the Lua code for a custom mode:
*** - The video engine's coordinate system should be set appropriately on every call to Reset()
*** - User input needs to be handled in the Update() call. Otherwise expected changes such as quit and pause inputs by
***   the user will be ignored.
