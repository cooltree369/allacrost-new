-- Filename: weapons.lua
--
-- Description: This file contains the definitions of all weapons that exist in
-- Hero of Allacrost. Each weapon has a unique integer identifier that is used
-- as its key in the weapons table below. Weapon IDs are unique not only among
-- each other, but among other inventory game objects as well (items, armor,
-- etc).
--
-- Object IDs 10,001 through 20,000 are reserved for weapons. Do not break this 
-- limit, because other value ranges correspond to other types of inventory objects.
--
-- Weapons IDs do -not- need to be sequential. When you make a new weapon, keep it 
-- grouped with similar weapon types (swords with swords, etc.) and keep a buffer of
-- space between group types. This way we won't get a mess of random weapons all over
-- this file.
--
-- All weapon entries need the following data to be defined:
-- {name}: Text that defines the name of the weapon.
-- {description}: A brief description about the weapon.
-- {icon}: The filepath to the image icon representing this weapon.
-- {physical_attack}: The amount of physical damage that the weapon causes.
-- {ethereal_attack}: The amount of ethereal damage that the weapon causes.
-- {standard_price}: The standard asking price of this weapon from merchants.
-- {usable_by}: A list of characters which may equip this weapon.
-- {slots}: The number of slots available to equip shards on the weapon.
