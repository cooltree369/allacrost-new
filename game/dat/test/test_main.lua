-- Filename: test_main.lua

-- Description: This file serves as a directory for all available functional tests
-- that are used by the TestMode class. All test categories and the properties of
-- those categories are listed in this file. Categories reserve a range of test IDs
-- so that every test ID is a unique integer. Each category is required to have the
-- following information defined.
--
-- name: A short name for the category of tests
-- description: A longer piece of text describing what the tests in this category perform
-- min_id: The low end of the range of test IDs reserved by the category
-- max_id: The high end of the range of test IDs reserved by the category
-- file: The filename where the tests for this category are defined
--
-- If any of this information is missing, the test category will not appear in TestMode.
-- Although note that it is acceptable for a test file to contain no tests and the category
-- for the test will still appear in this case.
