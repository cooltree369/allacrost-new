-- Filename: support.lua
--
-- Description: This file contains the definitions of all support skills that
-- exist in Hero of Allacrost. Each support skill has a unique integer identifier
-- that is used as its key in the skills table below. Some skills are primarily
-- intended for characters to use while others are intended for enemies to use.
-- Normally, we do not want to share skills between characters and enemies as
-- character skills animate the sprites while enemy skills do not. Unlike attack
-- and defense skills, support skills may optionally be executed from the character
-- menu and their use is thus not restricted to battles alone.
--
-- Skill IDs 20,001 through 30,000 are reserved for support skills.
--
-- Each skill entry requires the following data to be defined:
-- {name}: Text that defines the name of the skill
-- {description}: A brief (one sentence) description of the skill
--                (This field is required only for character skills and is optional for enemy skills)
-- {sp_required}: The number of skill points (SP) that are required to use the skill
--                (Zero is a valid value for this field, but a negative number is not)
-- {warmup_time}: The number of milliseconds that the actor using the skill must wait between
--                selecting the skill and executing it (a value of zero is valid).
-- {target_type}: The type of target the skill affects, which may be an attack point, actor, or party.
--
-- Each skill entry requires a function called {BattleExecute} to be defined. This function implements the
-- execution of the skill in battle, buffing defense, causing status changes, playing sounds, and animating
-- sprites.
--
-- Each skill may optionally have a {FieldExecute} function defined. This function defines what happens when
-- the skill is used from the character menu in the field. This function will typically be more simple than
-- the battle execute function as it does not need to worry about sprite animation or other battle specific
-- features. If the skill does not have this function defined, then the skill will not be usable from the
-- character menu.
