-- Filename: head_armor.lua
--
-- Description: This file contains the definitions of all head armor that exist in
-- Hero of Allacrost. Each armor has a unique integer identifier that is used
-- as its key in the armor table below. Armor IDs are unique not only among
-- each other, but among other inventory game objects as well (items, weapons,
-- other classes of armor, etc).
--
-- Object IDs 20,001 through 30,000 are reserved for head armor. Do not break this 
-- limit, because other value ranges correspond to other types of inventory objects.
--
-- Armor IDs do -not- need to be sequential. When you make a new armor, keep it 
-- grouped with similar armor types (helmets with helmets, etc.) and keep a buffer of
-- space between group types. This way we won't get a mess of random head armor all over
-- this file.
--
-- All armor entries need the following data to be defined:
-- {name}: Text that defines the name of the armor.
-- {description}: A brief description about the armor.
-- {icon}: The filepath to the image icon representing this armor.
-- {physical_defense}: The amount of physical defense that the armor provides.
-- {ethereal_defense}: The amount of ethereal defense that the armor casues.
-- {standard_price}: The standard asking price of this armor from merchants.
-- {usable_by}: A list of characters which may equip this armor,
-- {slots}: The number of slots available to equip shards on the armor.
