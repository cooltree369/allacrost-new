/** ***************************************************************************
*** \brief Retains a tileset's image and other properties
***
*** Tileset data comes from two different files:
***     - The tileset image file (.png), located in img/tilesets
***     - The tileset data file (.lua), located in lua/data/tilesets
***
*** Every tileset image file (TIF) has the same dimensions of 512x512 pixels. This means
*** that they can all hold 256 32x32 pixel tiles in 16 rows and 16 columns. Although
*** not every tile area within a tileset image is guaranteed to contain image data
*** (some tile areas may simply be empty/transparent space).
***
*** The tileset definition file (TDF) defineds the properties of the tileset file.
*** The name of the TDF matches the name of the TIF. So for example, a TIF named
*** "desert_landscape.png" would have a corresponding TDF named "desert_landscape.lua".
*** The TDF contains a user-friendly name of the tileset (as it will be seen in the editor),
*** collision information about which quadrants of each tile may not be moved over by
*** sprites on a map, any animations built from tiles in the tileset, and autotile data
*** that is used to improve map editing.
***
*** This class is responsible for the loading of data from the TDF and TIF and saving
*** modified data back to the TDF. The TIF is never modified by this class.
***
*** \note It is possible for multiple TDFs to map to a single TIF, although it would be
*** highly uncommon. One reason might be if  you wanted certain tiles to have different
*** collision properties on one map versus another. In this case, obviously you couldn't
*** match the name of both TDFs to the TIF file. This is why the TDF contains the name of
*** the TIF it uses.
