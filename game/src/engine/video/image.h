*** \brief   Source file for image classes
***
*** This file contains several classes that represent images loaded into the
*** engine. The public classes used outside of the video engine are:
***
*** - <b>ImageDescriptor</b> is an abstract base class for other images. This
*** type is used to allow containers to create multiple derived image classes.
*** It also contains a number of static functions for general image operation
*** code.
***
*** - <b>StillImage</b> is a single non-animated image and is what the user
*** will utilize most of the time.
***
*** - <b>AnimatedImage</b> is an animated image that contains multiple frames,
*** where a frame is a StillImage object along with timing information.
***
*** - <b>AnimationFrame</b> is a single frame of animation. It consists of a
*** StillImage, and how long the frame should be displayed in the animation.
*** This class is contained in the private_video namespace and is not a part
*** of the image manipulation API.
***
*** - <b>CompositeImage</b> is an image formed by piecing together multiple
*** StillImage objects. The image elements in a composite image may or may
*** not overlap one another
***
*** \note A <b>multi image</b> is nothing more than a single image file which
*** contains multiple adjacent sub-images within it. For example, a tileset file
*** contains numerous tile images. All sub-images are required to have the same
*** dimensions in a multi image file. Multi images are never explicitly contained
*** in any way by the video engine -- rather, these multi images are loaded into
*** memory and then the sub-images are split up into separate StillImage objects.

*** \brief An abstract base class for all public API image classes
***
*** This class also contains several static functions for performing image
*** operations which do not operate on a single instance of a derived
*** ImageDescriptor object. For example, functions which load a single image
*** file into multiple StillImage objects.
***
*** \note A <b>multi image</b> is defined as a single image file which contains
*** several images in a grid format that we wish to extract as seperate image
*** entities. This is used, for example, to hold multiple tile images in a large
*** tileset file, or multiple animation frames stored in a single image file.
*** All individual image elements in a multi image are required to be the same
*** size.
***
*** \note The copy constructor and copy assignement operator ensure that the
*** reference to the texture being used is updated appropriately. The
*** derived classes should not require the implementation of a copy constructor
*** or assignment operator, at least not for the purposes of proper reference
*** counting.
***
*** \note If the destructor finds that the image texture has no more references
*** after it decrements the reference counter, it will mark it as free on the
*** image texture's texture sheet. However it will <b>not</b> attempt to remove
*** it from any container in the TextureManager class, so that is up to the
*** destructors of the derived classes to implement.
