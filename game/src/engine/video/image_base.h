*** \author  Tyler Olsen, roots@allacrost.org
*** \brief   Header file for image base classes
***
*** This file contains several classes that represent various types of images
*** and image data manipulated by the video engine. All of these classes are
*** embedded in the private_video namespace, and thus are of no concern to
*** those who simply wish to use the video engine API. Below is a list and
*** short description of all the classes represented defined in this header:
***
*** - <b>ImageMemory</b> is a class used for loading and manipulating raw
*** image data stored in a system side buffer (ie not in texture memory)
***
*** - <b>BaseTexture</b> describes a sub-rectangle contained within a
*** texture sheet. In other words, it can essentially be viewed as a pointer
*** to an image's location in texture memory. It is an abstract class.
***
*** - <b>ImageTexture</b> derives from BaseTexture and adds a filename
*** and tag information to the member data. This is used to internally
*** represent an image that has been loaded from a file and any special
*** properties of that image data.
***
*** \note There are more derived classes from this set in other areas of the
*** code. In particular, there is a TextTexture and TextElement class
*** defined in the text.h header file.

*** \brief Represents the location and properties of an image in texture memory
***
*** This class can be thought of as a pointer to the image in texture (GPU)
*** memory. The TextureManager singleton has a container filled with each
*** instance of this object (and its derivative classes), which primarily
*** serves to prevent the duplication of the same image data in more than one
*** location in texture memory.
***
*** \note Whenever you create an instance of this class or one of its child
*** classes and you intend to have some piece of code use it, you MUST remember
*** to call AddReference() at least once, otherwise bad things can happen.
***
*** \note Objects of this class are intended to be constructed via the new
*** operator. The copy constructor and copy assignment operator are kept
*** private because we do not wish to allow duplicate pointers to the same
*** texture data, as this greatly complicates the reference counting system.
***
*** \note Although this class is not abstract, typically we do not create any
*** instances of it. Instead, we create instances of its derivative classes.
