/** ***************************************************************************
*** \brief A simple container class for creating notifications of important events
***
*** Sometimes when the code is running and detects that some event happens, it wants to notify other
*** code about the occurence. These notification events may be examined by other running code and trigger
*** some action or change to take place depending on the type and properties of the event. This class is
*** the lowest level type of notification event.
***
*** Notifications are identified using two different strings. The first identifies the area of the game that
*** generated the notification. Typically this should be the similar to the namespace that contained the code.
*** So the "hoa_battle" namespace uses "battle" as its identifer. The second string is used to inidicate
*** the type of event that caused the trigger to be generated, which could be anything from "collision" to
*** "equipped_weapon".
***
*** Many notifications will desire more data than these two strings can provide to indicate any particular state
*** or conditions that caused the notification to be generated. This class should be sub-classed appropriately
*** to generate such notification events.

	*** line and follow the format: "ClassName::category/event - extra data here" to maintain consistency.

*** \brief Maintains a list of all notifications that have occurred since the last game loop update
***
*** This is a very simple engine class that does little more than maintain a list of NotificationEvent
*** objects that it provides access to. Once a NotificationEvent object is passed to this function, it
*** assumes responsibility for making sure that the object gets destroyed appropriately. So you
*** should never call delete on a NotificationEvent object that is contained in the trigger list for this class.
***
*** \note One way to iterate through all triggers in the list is to simply continue to call GetNotificationEvent()
*** with increasing index arguments until it returns NULL, at which case you've reached the end of the list.
