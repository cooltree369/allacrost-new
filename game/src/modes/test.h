*** \brief A game mode used for debugging and testing purposes
***
*** This is a game mode that players will not encounter during the game. The mode manages
*** a simple GUI interface that lists all of the available tests that can be run and allows
*** the user to select from among those tests. The available tests are defined in TEST_MAIN_FILENAME.
*** 
*** The way to activate test mode is either through running the program executable with the -t/--test option,
*** or through the Ctrl+T meta key when the game is in BootMode. When starting TestMode via the command-line,
*** the user may optionally include a test ID number to immediately begin running a specific test. Whenever an
*** instance of TestMode exists on the game stack, the Ctrl+T command will clear the game stack of any other modes
*** and return TestMode to be the active game mode. Ctrl+T will otherwise be ignored if the active game mode is
*** not BootMode or no TestMode instance is found on the game stack.
*** 
*** Once in TestMode, the GUI will display three windows. The vertical window on the left side lists all of the
*** test categories. The vertical window on the right side lists all of the available tests for the selected category.
*** And the horizontal window on the bottom of the screen is used to display information text about the selected
*** category or test.
