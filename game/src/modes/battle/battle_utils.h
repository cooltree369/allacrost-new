*** make the most use of these functions. Thus, these functions are specifically designed for that use
*** and do not utilize C++ features that Lua can not take advantage of, such as references or default
*** values for function arguments.
***
*** There are also many functions that share the same name but have a different function signature. These
*** functions perform the same task but some take extra arguments to make the calculation more flexible. For
*** example, many functions have a version that allows adjustment of the variation by accepting a standard deviation
*** argument.
***
*** \note These calculations only work for valid non-party type targets. If it is desired to use these methods
*** on a party target, a set of targets for each actor in the target party must be extracted and those actor
*** targets used individually for these various methods.

/** ****************************************************************************
*** \brief A simple container class for items that may be used in battle
***
*** This class adds an additional member to be associated with GlobalItem objects
*** which keeps track of how many of that item are available to use. This is necessary
*** because when an actor selects an item to use, they do not immediately use that
*** item and may ultimately not use the item due to the user becoming incapacitated
*** or having no valid target for the item. At all times, the available count of an item
*** will be less than or equal to the actual count of the item.
***
*** The proper way to use this class is to call the following methods for the following
*** situations.
***
*** - DecrementAvailableCount(): call when an actor has selected to use an item
*** - IncrementAvaiableAcount(): call when an actor does not use an item that it selected
*** - DecrementCount(): call when the item is actually used
***
*** \note Do not call the IncrementCount(), DecrementCount(), or SetCount() methods on the GlobalItem
*** pointer. This will circumvent the ability of this class to keep an accurate and correct available
*** count. Instead, use the IncrementCount() and DecrementCount() methods of this BattleItem class
*** directly.
