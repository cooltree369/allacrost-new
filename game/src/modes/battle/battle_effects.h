*** \brief Manages all data related to a single status effect in battle
***
*** This class extends the GlobalStatusEffect class, which contains nothing
*** more than two enum members representing the status type and intensity. This
*** class provides a complete implementation of a status effect, including an
*** image icon, a timer, and script functions to implement the effect.
***
*** This class represents an active effect on a single actor. Objects of this
*** class are not shared on multiple actors in any form. Status effects only
*** have positive intensity values and will naturally decrease in intensity over
*** time until they reach the neutral intensity level. Some types of status
*** effects have an opposite type. For example, one status effect may boost the
*** actor's strength while another drains strength. We do not allow these two
*** statuses to co-exist on the same actor, thus the two have a cancelation effect
*** on each other and the stronger (more intense) effect will remain.
***
*** \todo Implement opposite types for status effects and possibly add a boolean
*** member to indicate whether the status is aiding or ailing.

*** used only for character actors to draw on the bottom menu. There should also
*** probably be another draw function for drawing the status of an actor to the
*** command window.

*** \todo Elemental effects are not yet implemented or supported by this class.
*** They should be added when elemental effects in battle are ready to be used.

	*** opposite type (e.g., strength gain status versus strength depletion status) and change the state of both effects
