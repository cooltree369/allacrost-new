*** \brief Abstract base class representing an effect that is active on an actor
***
*** Battle effects change the dynamic of battles. There are two different types of
*** effects, both which inherit from this base class. Actor effects change the
*** state of common battle operations, such as an actor being able to defend an
*** ally from receiving damage for a short while. These effects may be the result
*** of using a skill,
***
*** Status effects change the state of a single actor and have a visible indicator
*** of the status on the screen. Status effects include things like attribute modifiers,
*** paralsysis, and so on.

*** \brief Manages all data related to a single status effect in battle
***
*** A status effect is a special type of battle effect that has an intensity,
*** visual indicator, and gradually dissipates over time. An object of this class
*** represents an active status on a single actor. Status effects never apply to
*** more than one actor, although multiple actors may each have the same type of
*** status effect active.
***
*** Status effects only have positive intensity values and will naturally decrease
*** in intensity over time until they reach the neutral intensity level, upon which
*** they are removed. Some types of status effects have an opposite type. For example,
*** one status effect may increase the actor's strength while another decreases strength.
*** We do not allow these two statuses to co-exist on the same actor, thus the two have a
*** cancelation effect on each other and the stronger (more intense) effect will remain.
***
*** This class is abstract and thus can not be instantiated. It contains all common data and
*** functionality that other types of status effects utilize. In the Lua definition for the
*** status effect, there are three functions which may be optionally defined: Apply, Update,
*** and Remove. These functions are called during different points of the status effect's life
*** cycle.
