*** \brief An abstract class for displaying information about a change in an actor's state
***
*** Indicators are text or graphics that appear next to actor sprites in battle.
*** They typically represent changes to the actor such as numeric text representing
*** damage or healing, icons representing status effects, etc. The standard draw
*** sequence for elements comes in three stages to make the indicators presence and
*** disappearance more natural.
***
*** -# An initial transparent fade in of element over a short period of time
*** -# Element draw at full opacity
*** -# Finishing with a brief transparent fade out of the element
***
*** \note Indicators are drawn at different orientations for different actors. For
*** example, indicator elements and draw to the left of character actors and to
*** the right for enemy actors.
