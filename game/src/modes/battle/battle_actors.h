/** ****************************************************************************
*** \brief An abstract class for representing an actor in the battle
***
*** An "actor" is a term used to represent both characters and enemies in battle.
*** This abstract class contains members and methods that are common to both types of
*** actors. As such, many of the implemented methods in this class are virtual.
***
*** The BattleActor class contains a pointer to a GlobalActor object that represents
*** the character or enemy. BattleActor contains its own members for all actor stats such
*** as HP, strength, evade rating, etc. There are two reasons why BattleActor uses its own
*** members instead of directly accessing and modifying the members of the GlobalActor pointer.
*** First, various effects can occur in battle which can modify otherwise static stats such as
*** agility. We need the ability to restore each stat to its base value, and the GlobalActor
*** class retains that unaltered value. Second, if the player loses the battle and chooses to
*** retry, we need to restore all actors back to their original state before the battle began.
*** Retreiving the values of the GlobalActor class allows us to do so.
***
*** Throughout the battle, actors progress through a series of states. The
*** standard set of states that an actor cylces through while they are "alive"
*** and participating in the battle are as follows.
***
*** -# ACTOR_STATE_IDLE
*** -# ACTOR_STATE_COMMAND
*** -# ACTOR_STATE_WARM_UP
*** -# ACTOR_STATE_READY
*** -# ACTOR_STATE_ACTING
***
*** Throughout each cycle, the actor will select or be given an action to execute.
*** This action may be to attack an actor on the opposing team, heal a teammate,
*** use an item, or perform some sort of skill. Each actor is responsible for the
*** management of the action that they intend to take.

	*** - If this status is not already active on the character and the intensity argument is positive,

	***   no change will occur.
	*** - If this status is active and intensity is positive, intensity will be increased but will not
	***   exceed the maximum intensity level.
	*** - If this status is active, the intensity is positive, and the current intensity of the status
	***   is already at the maximum level, the status timer will be reset and the intensity will not change.
	*** - If this status is active and intensity is negative, intensity will be decreased but not allowed
	***   to go lower than the neutral level. If the neutral level is reached, the status will be removed.
	*** - If this status is active and the intensity is GLOBAL_INTENSITY_NEG_EXTREME, the status will be
	***   removed regardless of its current intensity level.
	*** - If this status has an opposite status type that is active on the actor and the intensity argument
	***   is positive, this will decrease the intensity of the opposite status by the degree of intensity.
	***   This may cause that opposite status to be removed and this new status to be added if the value of
