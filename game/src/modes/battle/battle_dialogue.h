*** \brief   Header file for battle dialogue code
***
*** Dialogue that occurs during a battle typically involves the characters in the
*** active party and their opponents, though this code supports external speakers
*** for those circumstances that require a speaker that is not directly on the
*** battlefield. Most of the time, the battle action is paused while a dialogue
*** is active. It is possible though to define dialogues that defy this common
*** behavior and are displayed while the battle is in progress. These types of
*** dialogues are typically timed or have some other termination condition, as
*** the player is unable to provide input to this type of dialogue.
***
*** The common format to constructing and executing a dialogue in a battle script
*** is to perform the following:
***
*** - In the script's "Load()" function, define all battle speakers and all dialogues
***   that may take place during the battle.
*** - In the script's "Update()" function, check for the conditions necessary to initiate
***   a dialogue and launch the dialogue when those conditions are met.

*** \brief Represents a dialogue that occurs during the midst of battle
***
*** Battle dialogues are very similar to the common dialogue class and only expand
*** upon it in two ways. First, each line requires a speaker to be declared. This is
*** done by providing an integer ID that represents the speaker. Second, it provides
*** a single boolean member used to determine whether or not the battle action should
*** halt while the dialogue is active (the default behavior of a dialogue is to halt
*** battle action).
***
*** \note If you wish the dialogue to not halt the battle action, usually you want all
*** of the dialogue lines to be timed so that the dialogue progresses on its own. The
*** player is unable to send any input to the dialogue when this property is active. If you
*** do not have timing for all of the lines, then you will need some sort of mechanism in the
*** battle script that will terminate the dialogue or force it to proceed to the next line when
*** a certain condition is met. In general, be cautious about dialogues where battle action is
*** not halted.
