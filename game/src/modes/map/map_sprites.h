*** \brief A special type of sprite with no physical image
***
*** The VirtualSprite is a special type of MapObject because it has no physical
*** form (no image). Virtual sprites may be manipulated to move around on the screen
*** just like any other sprite. VirtualSprites do take collision detection into account
*** by default, unless the no_collision member is set to true. Here are some examples of
*** where virtual sprites may be of use:
***
*** - As a mobile focusing point for the map camera
*** - As an impassible map location for ground objects in a specific context only
*** - To set impassible locations for objects in the sky layer
***
*** \note The VirtualSprite class serves as a base class for all other types of
*** sprites.
