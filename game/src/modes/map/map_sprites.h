*** The VirtualSprite is a special type of MapObject because it has no physical form (no image). Virtual sprites may be
*** manipulated to move around on the screen just like any other sprite. The visible and collidable properties are set
*** to false during construction. Some possible uses for a virtual sprite include:
***
*** - A mobile focusing point for the map camera
*** - An impassible map location for other sprites and objects in a specific context
***
*** \note The VirtualSprite class serves as a base class for all other types of sprites.

*** \brief A mobile map object that represents a hostile force
***
*** Enemy sprites have all the same features and functionality as a map sprite.
*** In addition to this, they have some additional data and methods that are commonly
*** needed for enemies encountered on a map, including:
***
*** - State information to determine if an enemy is spawning, dead, etc.
*** - Ability to be controlled by an EnemyZone, used for restricting the area where an enemy may roam
*** - Battle data to determine what enemies, music, etc. are loaded when a battle begins
***
*** Enemies typically are either spawned and controlled by their owning enemy zones,
*** or are controlled through scripting if they do not belong to any zones. You want to
*** be very careful about performing any custom scripting for an enemy controlled by a
*** zone, as the zone runs update logic that may counteract what you are trying to do
*** with an enemy.
***
*** Every enemy has a state that determines how the enemy is being updated and drawn.
*** This is true regardless of whether or not the enemy is controlled by a zone, but
*** the order of state logic defers between the two.
*
*** There are really two types of enemy sprites. The first type behave just like
*** map sprites and can have scripted movement sequences. The second type belong
*** to EnemyZones, where they fade into existence and pursue after the player's
*** sprite should the player enter the zone.
***
*** An enemy sprite in a zone can be in one of 3 states: SPAWNING, HOSTILE or DEAD.
*** In the spawning state, the enemy becomes gradually visible, is immobile, and
*** cannot be touched or attacked. In the hostile state, the enemies roams the map
*** and will cause a battle if touched by the player. In the dead state, the enemy
*** is invisible and waits for the EnemyZone to reset it in another position, so
*** that it may spawn once more.
