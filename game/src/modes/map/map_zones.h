*** \brief An advanced map zone which keeps track of its resident sprites
***
*** This zone class enhances the skeletal MapZone by adding features which keep
*** track of the sprites which exist in this zone, as well as when those sprites
*** enter and exit the zone area. This is very useful information for zones which
*** trigger map events, for instance, when a sprite interacts with the zone area.
*** Sprites inhabiting the zone are called "residents", hence the nomenclature for
*** this class.
***
*** ResidentZones are updated by the ObjectSupervisor. Every time a sprite's position
*** is changed, it is marked and all zones that share the same context as the sprite
*** are examined to see if the sprite has entered or left any zones. Because it is
*** quite common to want to determine if the sprite pointed to by the camera has interacted
*** with the zone area, there are specific functions that provide for that ability, to
*** ease the burden on the map script writers.
***
*** It is necessary to define which map contexts the zone takes effect on so that
*** only sprites that share a common context with a zone are taken into account. Note that
*** a zone can be active in any number of the available map contexts, since it stores a bit
*** mask value of contexts where the zone is active. Also note that this class examines
*** resident sprites, but not lower classes of objects (which typically do not move and
*** likewise we would not want to trigger any sort of event).
