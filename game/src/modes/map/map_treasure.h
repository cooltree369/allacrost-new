*** \brief Represents an obtainable treasure on the map which the player may access
***
*** A treasure is a specific type of physical object, usually in the form of a
*** treasure chest. When the player accesses these treasures, the chest animates as
*** it is being opened and the treasure supervisor is initialized once the opening
*** animation is complete. Each treasure object on a map has a global event associated
*** with it to determine whether the treasure contents have already been retrieved by
*** the player.
***
*** Image files for treasures are single row multi images where the frame ordering
*** goes from closed, to opening, to open. This means each map treasure has exactly
*** three animations. The closed and open animations are usually single frame images.
***
*** To add contents to the treasure for this object, you will need to retreive the
*** pointer to the TreasureContainer object via the GetTreasure() method, then add drunes
*** and/or objects (items/equipment/etc) to the TreasureContainer.
***
*** \todo Add support for more treasure features, such as locked chests, chests which
*** trigger a battle, etc.

*** \brief Represents hidden treasures on the map that appear occasionally as a brief glimmer
***
*** Glimmer treasures can contain the same contents as MapTreasures, but take a slightly different
*** role. Instead of an open/opening/closed image animations, a glimmer treasure has only one animation,
*** a brief "glimmer" that is displayed only occasionally, to make them harder for the player to find.
*** Once a glimmer treasure is obtained, the animation will no longer display. The animation does not
*** need to be actively displaying for the player to acquire the treasure.
***
*** All glimmer animation image files are stored in a format of 32x32 pixels for each frame, so we can
*** compute each frame automaticaly from the image size. The amount of time to wait between glimmer display
*** animations is variable based on a Gaussian curve, so that multiple visible glimmer animations never appear
*** in-sync. If the standard deviation is left unspecified, then a value of 5% of the average delay will be used.
***
*** \note If you desire custom behavior for when the glimmer occurs (stepping on a switch, for example), then you
*** should SetDisplayEnabled(false) to turn off the normal behavior, and can then call ForceDisplay() whenever you
*** determine that you want the animation to be displayed

*** \brief Displays the contents of a discovered treasure in a menu window
***
*** Upon opening a treasure chest or other treasure-containing map object, this menu
*** will appear and list the amount of drunes found (if any), a list of the icon and name of
*** each GlobalObject found (items, equipment, etc), and a list of player options.
*** The player may select to view detailed information about a particular entry, go to menu mode,
*** and possibly other actions in the future.
***
*** The treasure menu is composed of three sets of windows. The action window is a small window
*** at the top of the menu that displays the action options in a horizontal list. The list window
*** displays the contents of the treasure in a larger window below the action window. This object
*** list is formatted vertically. The detail window shares the same area as the list window and
*** displays textual and visual detail about an object selected by the user from the list window.
***
*** Proper utilization of this class entails the following steps:
***
*** -# Call the Initialize method to show the menu with the treasure that has been obtained
*** -# Call the Update method to process user input and update the menu's appearance
*** -# Call the Draw method to draw the menu to the screen
*** -# Call the Finish method to hide the menu and add the treasure's contents to the player's
***    inventory
***
*** \todo Allow the player to use or equip selected treasure objects directly from the
*** action menu.
***
*** \todo Add visual scissoring to the list window so that the option list or detail text does
*** not exceed the window boundary when the text or list is exceedingly long.
***
*** \todo Instead of forcing the detail window to share the list window, maybe it would look
*** better if there was a separate detail window which "popped out" of the other two windows
*** and could be placed over them when it was visible? I think this would be much more visually
*** pleasing than the current implementation.
