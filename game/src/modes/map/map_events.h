*** \brief   Header file for map mode events and event processing
***
*** Events occur on map mode to alter the state of the map, present a scene to the
*** player, or do any other custom task we require. Events may be "chained" together
*** so that one event begins as another ends. Many events are scripted, but this
*** file contains some C++ implementations of the most common types of events so
*** that these do not have to be continually re-implemented in every Lua map file.

*** \brief A container class representing a link between two map events
***
*** Map events may trigger additional events to occur alongside it or following
*** it. This class represents a "link" between two events and describes how the
*** two events are linked. In an event link there is a parent event and a child
*** event. The parent and child events may begin at the same time, or the child
*** event may occur after the parent event starts, but the child will never
*** preceed the parent's start. This class only stores the event_id of the child,
*** and the link object is added as a member onto the parent event's class. When
*** the parent event gets processed, all links are examined and the children events
*** are prepared appropriately.
***
*** We use two pieces of information to determine when to start a child event relevant
*** to its parent. The first is a boolean value that indicates whether the child's
*** start is relative to the parent's start or the parent's finish. The second is a
*** time value that indicates how long to wait (in milliseconds) from the parent's
*** start/finish before starting the child event.

*** \brief An abstract class representing an event that occurs on a map
***
*** An event can be virtually anything from playing a sound to moving a sprite
*** to beginning a dialogue. Events do not necessarily inform the user (through
*** visual or audio means) that an event has occurred. They may be employed to
*** change the state of a map without the player's knowledge. This is an abstract
*** class because common types of events (such as beginning a dialogue) are implemented
*** in C++ code while Lua is used to represent not-so-common types of events.
***
*** All events have a unique, non-zero, unsigned integer value that serve to
*** distinguish the events from one another (an ID number). Events can also contain any
*** number of "links" to children events, which are events which launch simultaneously
*** with or some time after the parent event. Events are processed via two
*** functions. _Start() is called only one when the event begins. _Update() is called
*** once for every iteration of the main game loop until this function returns a true
*** value, indicating that the event is finished.

*** # Before returning true in the _Update() method, call _sprite->ReleaseControl(this)
***
*** \note It is important to keep in mind that all map sprites have their update
*** function called before map events are updated. This can have implications for
*** changing some members of the sprite object inside the _Start() and _Update() methods
*** as these methods are called <i>after</i> the sprite's own Update() method. Keep
