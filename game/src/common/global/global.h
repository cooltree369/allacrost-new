*** contains the current characters in the party, the party's inventory, etc.
*** The definition of characters, items, and other related global data are
*** implemented in the other global header files (e.g. global_actors.h). All
*** of these global files share the same hoa_global namespace.

*** \brief A container that manages the occurences of several related game events
***
*** Events in Allacrost are nothing more than a string-integer pair. The string
*** represents the name of the event while the integer takes on various meanings
*** about the event. One example of an event could be if the player has already
*** seen a certain piece of dialogue, and the integer would be set to zero or
*** non-zero to emulate a boolean value. Another example could be whether the
*** player previous chose option A, B, C, or D when presented with a list of
*** possible actions to take, in which the integer value would represent the
*** option taken.
***
*** Because we want to continually look-up whether or not an event has occured,
*** it is not efficient to store all game events in a single container (the
*** larger the number of events, the longer the event search time). Instead,
*** this class collectively represents a group of related events. A typical
*** event group could represent all of the events that occured on a particular
*** map, for instance.
***
*** \note Other parts of the code should not have a need to construct objects of
*** this class. The GameGlobal class maintains a container of GlobalEventGroup
*** objects and provides methods to allow the creation, modification, and
*** retrieval of these objects.
