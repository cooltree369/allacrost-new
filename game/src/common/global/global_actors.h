*** also contains classes that are closely related to the implementation of actors

*** \brief Represents a playable game character
***
*** This class represents playable game characters that join the party and can
*** participate in battles. It does not cover NPCs or any other form of character.
*** All characters have four attack points on the head, torso, arms, and legs.
*** Armor may also be equipped to cover all four of these points. This class
*** additionally retains references to loaded images of the character in various
*** formats such as sprites and portraits that are used across the different game modes.
***
*** Whenever a character gains additional experience points, there is a possibility that
*** growth may occur. Growth can occur even when the character has not reached a new experience
*** level, as the code allows for a gradual growth over time. A significant amount of growth should
*** always occur after achieving a new experience level.
***
*** The advised procedure for processing character growth is as follows.
*** -# Call AddExperiencePoints() to give the character additional XP.
*** -# If this method returns false, no further action is needed. Otherwise, growth has occurred and needs to be processed.
*** -# Call ReachedNewExperienceLevel() to determine whether the type growth is gradual or due to a
***    new experience level being reached.
*** -# If the growth type is gradual, call the various Get[STAT]Growth() methods and
***    report any non-zero values to the player. Then call AcknoledgeGrowth().
*** -# Otherwise if the growth type is a new level, report growth plus any skills
***    learned and call AcknoledgeGrowth() (*see note)
***
*** \note When an experience level is gained, after the call to AcknowledgeGrowth()
*** there may be new growth available (because the character gained multiple
*** experience levels or met the requirements for additional gradual growth for
*** the new experience level to gain). It is recommended practice to call AcknowledgeGrowth()
*** continuously until the fuction returns a false value, which indicates that no additional
*** growth is available.
***
*** \todo This class needs a better organized set of containers for its images.
*** The current containers and accessor methods are considered temporary.
