*** \brief Represents skills that are used in the game by both characters and enemies
***
*** Skills are actions that a character or enemy may take in battle. Some skills
*** may also be used on the field in menus (such as a healing spell). The functional
*** execution of a skill is done by a Lua function, which this class manages pointers
*** to. Typically skills are not shared between characters and enemies, primarily
*** because character sprites are fully animated when executing actions, while enemies
*** are not animated.
***
*** There are three types of skills: attack, defend, and support. Functionally the skills
*** are no different and this class represents all three types of skills. The skill types
*** exist for convenience purposes to lump skills into groups roughly based on the type
*** of effect they cause. Skill definitions and execution functions are retained in
*** one of three Lua files (a file exists for each type of skill) and these files are used
*** to initialize the skill's data.
***
*** Because skills are scripted and can achieve almost any possible effect, this class
*** only retains the common properties that all skills share. For example, the skill's
*** name, type of target, and the amount of time it takes an actor to "warmup" to use
*** the skill or "cooldown" after the skill execution is finished.
